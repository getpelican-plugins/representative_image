# Summary

This plugin extracts a presentative image from the article's summary or article's content. The image can be access at `article.repImage`. 

The plugin also remove any images from the summary after extraction to avoid duplication. 

It allows the flexibility on where and how to display the representative image of an article together with its summary in a template page. For example, the article metadata can be displayed in thumbnail format, in which there is a short summary and an image. The layout of the summary and the image can be varied for aesthetical purpose. It doesn't have to depend on article's content format.
